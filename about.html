        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Hi, my name is David Carson and this is my personal website. Throughout the site you will be able to see all the areas of interest I have. Through the pages on the site who will see my education, places of work and sporting achievements. There are links to others sites which have information on me at the bottom of each page. A little bit about myself: I am currently 24 year old student at D.I.T. in town. I am studying a pre-masters in computing. I am also developing an App with my dad. It is a medical App for Hayfever self-learning and treatments and will be available in April/May 2016. I live in Mount Merrion, Blackrock. I play hockey for Monkstown Hockey Club and have represented Ireland 32 times. During this time I have won a number of trophies with club and country. More details can be found on the sports page.</p>
