    <h3>HayFever Relief</h3>
        <p>I am currently working along side my dad in creating a self-help and treatment App for people who suffer from Hayfever. Dr.Paul Carson 
        is the leading doctor in europe for Allergies and Hayfever. I came to him with the idea in the summer and we are now currently in the wireframe
        stages to mockup stages. We are working in situ with Tapadoo and the Science Picture Company to bring a world class App to the
        market. Due for release in March/April, it is very exciting times for this venture.</p>
